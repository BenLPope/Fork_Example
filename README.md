# Fork_Example

This program takes in 1 argument between 1 and 49 and finds the sum of the primes found. It will find the number of primes you designate. It uses a Sieve of Eratosthenes to find primes. Could be updated to add primes found during the run to the sieve.


Example of program usage:
a.out 2
Output of example:
      CHILD: The sum of the first 2 prime numbers is: 5
      CHILD: My PID is 16056 and it took me 462ns
      PARENT: Child PID is 16056 and the child finished in 462ns
      PARENT: My PID is 16055 and I finished in 4811ns
      PARENT: The first 2 prime numbers are...
      2
      3
      End of list. Program terminating.
